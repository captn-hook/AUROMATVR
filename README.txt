if you dont have room scale

if you have full body
eat it up!

roomscale loco for indoor scenes

outside, primarily roomscale to get around your focus, and 'hop' to move 

hopping is a crouch irl, followed by a quick stand up, like a jump

alternatively those with foot tracking can stomp the ground to jump

quick little bops should shimmie you like half a room, should feel finly controllable through repeated small hops

this needs to be not too much work while also not activating accidently 

longer and deeper crouches (or holding your foot up longer) should charge your jump, allowing for large traversal

need some vignetting on the jump to comfort
note
do not actuallu vignette

maube make the players 'suit' jump up more, and push them into the back of their seat, using the helmet visual as a frame of refrence
